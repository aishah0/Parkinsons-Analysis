## Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease Using Patient Data

This project explores clinical and lifestyle predictors of early-stage Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning and data visualization techniques. It is part of a project for STEM Fellowship's 2025 Inter-University Big Data Challenge.

### Objectives
- Identify important early indicators of Parkinson’s Disease.
- Visualize relationships between clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
- Train and evaluate a classification model for early diagnosis.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains clinical, demographic, and lifestyle information from over 2000 patients, including:
- Cognitive/functional scores (UPDRS, MoCA, etc.)
- Symptoms (Tremor, Bradykinesia, etc.)
- Risk factors (Family history, Diet, Sleep, etc.)

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- GitHub for version control
- MATLAB for advanced visualization
