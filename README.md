## Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease Using Patient Data

This project explores clinical and lifestyle predictors of early-stage Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning and data visualization techniques. It is part of a project for the the 2025 Inter-University Big Data Challenge.

### Objectives
- Identify important early indicators of Parkinson’s Disease.
- Visualize relationships between clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
- Train and evaluate a classification model for early diagnosis.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains clinical, demographic, and lifestyle information from over 2000 patients, including:
- Cognitive/functional scores (UPDRS, MoCA, etc.)
- Symptoms (Tremor, Bradykinesia, etc.)
- Risk factors (Family history, Diet, Sleep, etc.)

### Current Progress
- [x] Handled missing data and removed unnecessary columns.
- [x] Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables (e.g., Ethnicity).
- [x] Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:
  - Correlation analysis with `Diagnosis`
  - Heatmaps of symptom and lifestyle relationships

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- GitHub for version control
- MATLAB for advanced visualization
